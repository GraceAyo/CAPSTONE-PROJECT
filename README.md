## Overview
This project aim is to analyze and visualize Sales Data using the tools: Excel (for data cleaning, preparation, and PivotTable analysis); SQL Server (for complex querying and data manipulation); and PowerBI (for creating interactive and insightful visualizations). By leveraging these tools, we transformed raw data into actionable insights, providing a comprehensive understanding of sales performance across various dimensions.
## DATA SOURCE
## Objectives
To clean and prepare raw sales data for analysis.

To perform data analysis using Excel PivotTables.

To use SQL Server for advanced querying and data manipulation.

To visualize the data insights using PowerBI.
Tools Used
Excel: For initial data cleaning, preparation, and PivotTable analysis.

SQL Server: For writing complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

PowerBI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset contained several columns: Order ID, Customer ID, Product, Region, Order Date, Quantity, Unit Price, and Revenue (Total Sales). The following steps were taken to clean and prepare the data:

Remove Duplicates: Using Excelâ€™s Remove Duplicates feature to ensure data integrity.

Handle Missing Values: Identifying and addressing any missing or inconsistent data entries.

Data Transformation: Calculating additional metrics such as Total Sales by multiplying Quantity by Unit Price.

Date Formatting: Ensuring all date entries are consistent and correctly formatted.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Using Excel:
PivotTables: Created PivotTables to summarize and analyze sales data by Product, Region, and Order Date.

Example: Analyzing Total Sales by Product to identify top-selling items.

Calculating the average sales per product.

Conditional Formatting: Highlighted key data points such as regions with the highest sales.

Using SQL Server:
Querying Data: Utilized SQL queries to retrieve specific insights from the dataset.

Total sales for each product category.

Number of sales transactions in each region.

Identified the highest selling product by total sales value.

Calculated total revenue per product.

Calculated monthly sales totals for the current year.
Identified the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.

Calculated the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.

Identified products with no sales in the last quarter.
Dashboard Creation: Developed an interactive dashboard displaying key sales metrics.

Total Sales by Region: A bar chart visualizing sales distribution across regions.

Monthly Sales Trends: A line chart showing sales trends over the months.

Top Products and Customers: Pie charts illustrating top-selling products and top customers by purchase amount.

Sales Contribution by Region: A doughnut chart showing the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.

Interactive Filters: Enabled users to filter data by different dimensions such as date range, product category, and region for deeper insights.

By integrating these tools, the project successfully transformed raw sales data into valuable insights, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on data-driven analysis.
